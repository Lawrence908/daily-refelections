# Daily Reflections - Planning Notes

## Project Overview
A Flask-based web application for daily inspirational quotes with user contribution functionality.

## Features Implemented
- ✅ Deterministic quote of the day (based on day of year)
- ✅ Quote submission form
- ✅ JSON API endpoint
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Dark/light theme support
- ✅ Flash messaging system
- ✅ Data persistence with JSON files

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Storage
- Using JSON files for simplicity and portability
- `quotes.json`: Master collection of all quotes
- `user_entries.json`: Backup of user-submitted quotes
- No database required for MVP

### Quote Selection Algorithm
- Uses `datetime.now().timetuple().tm_yday` for deterministic selection
- Same quote shown for entire day globally
- Cycles through all available quotes based on day of year

### Styling Approach
- CSS custom properties for theme management
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Automatic dark/light mode based on user preference
- Clean, minimal design with good accessibility

## API Design

### Endpoints
- `GET /` - Homepage with quote of the day
- `GET /add` - Quote submission form
- `POST /add` - Process quote submission
- `GET /api/quote` - JSON endpoint for quote of the day

### Response Format (API)
```json
{
  "text": "Quote text here",
  "author": "Author Name"
}
```
